RedScrabble Project Overview

This is a word game built in Python, which is a crossover between the infamous gameshow countdown and Scrabble the household board game. The project was originally completed during Summer 2023 as part of a college project.

The game includes:

Word validation against a Scrabble dictionary

Score tracking with an SQLite database

A text-based interface for playing locally

It is a practice project that helped me learn about Python, game logic, and databases.

🎮 How to Play

Start the game Run the main script to launch the game in your terminal.

Place words This is a single player game. Each round you form valid words from your given letters, pressing enter to submit your word. You may use the same letter multiple times.

Scoring each word is checked for validity. Scores are assigned based on letter values (as in Scrabble). Scores are saved to a local SQLite database (Highscore.db).

Power-ups There are two power-ups in this game

The first being the 'shuffle rack' option. This enables you to replay a round with another deck of letters

The second being the 'X2 score' option If you believe you have a high scoring word, you can use the X2 score power-up before submitting the word to double the value of the letters.

REMINDER: These power-ups can be used in the same round and can only be used once in total.

Winning After 5 rounds your scores are combined to give you your final score.
